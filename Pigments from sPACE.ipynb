Historically, distinguishing between species, functional groups, and pigments was difficult due to the multi-spectral nature of the available instruments, which collected spectra, but with gaps. PACE fills these gaps and provides complete spectra that allows for the distinguishment between oceanic bio-optical parameters.\n\nThere are many pigments involved in photosynthesis. The pigments that are utilized by different phytoplankton functional groups and species relates to their biology and ecology where different pigments are more utilized for certain niches than others. These pigments have unique spectral signatures that can be captured and differentiated spatially. \n\nTremendous credit to Ali Chase as well as Emmanuel Boss, Ivona Cetinic, Wayne Slade, and Max Danenhower who created a Gaussian pigment estimation method that pulls salinity data from SMAP and temperature data from GHRSST, and uses it with PACE rrs data to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll pigments a, b, and c, as well as the concentration of photoprotective carotenoids for each pixel of PACE data. This was averaged for segments of three days. The data was then plotted where each pixel was represented by the concentration of the dominant pigment from the three-day average.","metadata":{}},{"id":"92c337a0-276e-4d0f-80d2-dc41e02e6e69","cell_type":"code","source":"# Create earthaccess connection\nimport earthaccess\nauth =
